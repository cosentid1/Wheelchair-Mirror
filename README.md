# Wheelchair-Mirror

This device was designed in a group of 4 to expand the field of view of an individual who used a wheelchair and had very limited neck mobility.

## Design Overview
The electrical design of this device uses the Arduino Uno R3. There are two buttons that are wired to be active high. This means that the Ardunio will continuously receive no signal from the buttons until they are pressed. These provide input signals to the Arduino. When a button has been pressed, a stepper motor will be activated to turn the mirror either left or right. To affix the electrical system onto the wheelchair, a mount was 3D printed to hold the breadboard components and another spot was added to hold the Arduino. Two clamps were added to the bottom of the mount with screw holes in them to securely hold the entire system on the arm of the wheelchair in a comfortable position. Finally, to make the mirror turn with the motor, a small circular piece with a slot was made to allow the mirror to rest on an angle.

## Next Steps
The main focus with improving this project is to make it a more market-ready product and less of a prototype. For starters, the wires are just left sticking out and are sprawling everywhere. To fix this, a printed circuit board could be designed to reduce the space that the whole electrical system takes up. The mount can then be sized down accordingly to take up less space on the user's wheelchair arm. As well, a cover can be made to hide this board and make the design more appealing to the eye.

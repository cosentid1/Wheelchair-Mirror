## Design Overview
The electrical design of this device is very straight forward. There are two buttons that are wired to be active high. These provide input signals to an arduino. When a button has been pressed a stepper motor will be activated to turn the mirror either left or right. To affix the electrical system onto the wheelchair, a mount was designed to hold the breadboard components and another spot was added to hold the arduino. Finally, a slot was made to slide the motor into. The bottom of the mount was then modelled with two clamps that have screw holes in them to securely hold the entire system on the arm of the wheelchair in a comfortable spot. Finally, to make the mirror turn with the motor, a small piece was made to allow the mirror to slot in on an angle.
